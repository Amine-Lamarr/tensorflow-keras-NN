<p>I'm really happy because I built it after only one morning lesson learning the basics of TensorFlow and Keras.</p>

<h1>Project Description</h1>

- Dataset: Iris dataset from sklearn
- Model: A simple neural network with 2 dense layers
- Purpose: Classification of iris flowers into 3 categories
- Activation functions: ReLU in the hidden layer and Softmax in the output layer for multi-class classification
